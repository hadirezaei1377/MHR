a simle and full webserver by golang, html, css, htmx and JS !

we use go templ for generating go codes(to prevent duplicate codes in each part) and use it for our webserver.

we use HTMX for managing html codes.
its useful for low level projects instead using react for front, but its modern.

we use alpine Js 
because we cant make any changes in a front-end request without connecting to back-end.
